              <CardTitle>Why Unionise?</CardTitle>
              <br />
              <CardDescription className="text-left">
                The Indian VFX & Animation industry is brimming with talent, yet
                many artists face challenges that hinder their careers and
                well-being. Here at Crafted Stack, we believe your artistic
                passion deserves fair treatment, secure work environments, and
                the opportunity to flourish.
              </CardDescription>
              <CardDescription className="text-left">
                Here&apos;s why unionizing with Crafted Stack makes a
                difference:
                <ul className="list-disc pl-5">
                  <li>
                    Stand Up for Fair Pay: Negotiate for competitive salaries
                    and benefits that reflect your skills and the value you
                    bring to projects. Don&apos;t settle for compensation that
                    doesn&apos;t recognize your contributions.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Combat Unpredictable Schedules: Crafted Stack fights for
                    reasonable working hours with clear overtime policies. You
                    shouldn&apos;t have to sacrifice your personal life for your
                    career.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Embrace Job Security: Fear of contract renewal should not be
                    a constant worry. Unionization provides a safety net,
                    ensuring fair treatment and protection against arbitrary
                    decisions.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Bridge the Gender Pay Gap: Crafted Stack advocates for equal
                    pay for equal work, regardless of gender or background. We
                    believe in a diverse and inclusive industry where talent is
                    valued, not discriminated against.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Modernize the Industry: Unions push for industry-wide
                    standards that promote healthy work practices and
                    sustainable careers.
                  </li>
                </ul>
                Together, we can create a thriving VFX & Animation industry in
                India, where artists are empowered to reach their full
                potential.
